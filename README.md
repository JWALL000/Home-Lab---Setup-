## Project Overview 

In this project I successfully installed and configured multiple servers and operating systems to make a fully on premise home lab setup. This project allowed my to further develop my Cybersecurity IT skills and allowed me to gain a better understanding of
how a basic corporate network and security tools work together. 

I was inspired to do this project after seeing a video from Steven at the myDFIR Youtube channel who I owe a big thank you to for the knowledge and tips. 

In the below steps, I hope to show you how I achieved this and how much I have learned since starting the project. 

Thank you to whoever takes the time to have a look at this project - it is much appreciated! 

Lets begin. 


I ended up going with Virtual Box as a hypervisor as I was the most familiar with it, I also used 4 Ubuntu servers(ELK, Fleet, SHH, Mythic) 2 Windows servers (one as a target server, one for osTicket) and an instance of Kali Linux.

## Step.1 

I started by configuring and setting up my ELK server. I then also decided to do this via SSH on my host machine as I found it easier to manage.
